Our new paper [On the (In)feasibility of ML Backdoor Detection]() has been accepted to appear at [AISTATS 2024](https://aistats.org/aistats2024/). In this paper we propose a theoretical framework that encompasses the problems of Backdoor and OOD detection, showing for the first time their intrinsic limitation which results in a ground breaking infeasibility theorem.

A huge shout-out to [Georg](https://scholar.google.at/citations?user=5lv1oKAAAAAJ&hl=en) for his fantastic work!

A preliminary version of [this paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=tYCLmx9RgE) has appeared at the [Backdoors in Deep Learning Workshop @ NeurIPS 2023](https://neurips2023-bugs.github.io/).
