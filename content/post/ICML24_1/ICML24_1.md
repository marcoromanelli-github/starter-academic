Our paper [Disparate Impact on Group Accuracy of Linearization for Private Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03629.pdf) was accepted to appear at the [Forty-first International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)](https://icml.cc/)! In this paper we analyzed the effects on Fairness due to ReLU budgeting for Private Inference speedup.

A huge shout-out to my great colleagues [Saswat](https://saswatdas.com/) and [Ferdinando](https://nandofioretto.github.io/) for their amazing work!
