Our paper [Beyond the Norms: Detecting Prediction Errors in Regression Models](https://hal.science/hal-04575936/document) was accepted to appear as a **spotlight** at the [Forty-first International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)](https://icml.cc/)! In this paper we propose a framework to evaluate uncertainty
in regression models!

A huge shout-out to my great colleagues [Andres](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TQWIH9oAAAAJ&hl=en), [Georg](https://scholar.google.at/citations?user=5lv1oKAAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Pablo](https://sites.google.com/mila.quebec/pablo-piantanida/home) for their amazing work!
