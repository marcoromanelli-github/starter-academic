Our new paper [Retrieval-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Boolean Circuit Minimization](https://openreview.net/forum?id=0t1O8ziRZp) has been accepted to appear at [ICLR 2024](https://iclr.cc/). In this paper we proposed an OOD detection based strategy to inform the reward function for policies in RL, with specific applications to secure automated hardware design.

A huge shout-out to [Animesh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_7dNuMwAAAAJ&hl=en) and the other co-authors.
