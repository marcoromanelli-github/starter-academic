Our recent paper [DOCTOR: A Simple Method for Detecting Misclassification Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02395) has been accepted as a **spotlight** presentation @ [NeurIPS 2021](https://neurips.cc/). A huge congrats to my main coauthors: [Pablo Piantanida](http://webpages.lss.supelec.fr/perso/pablo.piantanida/Welcome.html) who brilliantly supervised the project from the very beginning to the end, and [Federica Granese](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Federica.GRANESE/) whom I have been collaborating with since the beginning of my postdoc.
Stay tuned!
