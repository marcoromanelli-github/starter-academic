[![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/AISTATS-2024-<COLOR>.svg)](https://aistats.org/aistats2024/) Our new paper [Optimal Zero-Shot Detector for Multi-Armed Attacks]() has been accepted to appear at [AISTATS 2024](https://aistats.org/aistats2024/). In this paper we propose a minimum-regret optimal framework to aggregate adverarial attack detectors to minimize the worst-case risk.

A huge shout-out to [Federica](https://fgranese.github.io/) and [Pablo](https://sites.google.com/mila.quebec/pablo-piantanida/home) for their hard work!
